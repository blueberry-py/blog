## Tutorials

- DeepLearning.ai's [Claude Code: A Highly Agentic Coding Assistant](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/claude-code-a-highly-agentic-coding-assistant/) from Anthropic

> In this course, you‚Äôll learn best practices for using Claude Code to improve your coding workflow. You‚Äôll learn key tips on how to provide Claude Code with clear context, such as specifying the relevant files, clearly defining the features and functionality, and connecting Claude Code to MCP servers.

- [Fast Prototyping of GenAI Apps with Streamlit](https://www.coursera.org/learn/fast-prototyping-of-genai-apps-with-streamlit)

> Build and iterate GenAI apps in hours instead of days! Start with a simple chatbot, then add prompt engineering and RAG powered by Snowflake‚Äôs secure data and LLM services, then push your prototype to Snowflake or Streamlit Community Cloud for instant feedback and quick improvement.

- RealPython's [What Are Mixin Classes in Python?](https://realpython.com/python-mixin/)

> Mixins offer a powerful way to reuse code across multiple Python classes without forcing them into a rigid inheritance hierarchy. Instead of building deep and brittle class trees, you can use mixins to share common behaviors in a modular and flexible way.

## Articles

- [How Python Grew From a Language to a Community](https://thenewstack.io/how-python-grew-from-a-language-to-a-community/)

...

- [asyncio: a library with too many sharp corners](https://sailor.li/asyncio)

...

- [From Async/Await to Virtual Threads](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/7/26/virtual-threads/)

In this post Armin Ronacher explores the concept of virtual threads and structured concurrency as a way to simplify concurrent programming, especially in Python. It contrasts traditional async/await models with the idea of virtual threads managed in thread groups, where parallel tasks are spawned and automatically managed with cancellation and error propagation.

- [Agentic Coding Things That Didn‚Äôt Work](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/7/30/things-that-didnt-work/)

This is another post from Armin Ronacher in which Armin discusses various approaches and tools to improve workflow automation with LLMs but found ineffective. It is highlighted that clear, manual instruction often outperforms elaborate automations. They caution that over-reliance on automation leads to mental disengagement and reduced code quality, emphasizing the importance of active review and critical thinking.

- [Building MCP PyExec: Secure Python Execution Server with Docker & Authentication](https://objectgraph.com/blog/building-mcp-pyexec-python-execution-server/)

The blog details building MCP PyExec, a secure Python execution server using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It covers three components: the PyExec server implementing MCP for streaming Python code execution; an OAuth 2.0 Identity Provider (IDP) for secure authentication supporting authorization code flow, JWT, and token validation; and a PyExec client for testing and interaction that manages OAuth tokens and streaming results.

- [Introducing gpt-oss](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-oss/)

OpenAI has released their first open-weight models since GPT-2 - `gpt-oss-120b` and `gpt-oss-20b` - under Apache 2.0 license.

- [Why Observability Isn‚Äôt Just for SREs (and How Devs Can Get Started)](https://signoz.io/blog/why-observability-isnt-just-for-sres/)

This blog post serves as a guide for developers to understand the importance of observability and provides a playbook for integrating it into their workflow. Observability helps developers maintain cleaner code, manage systems better, and reduce technical debt by considering more edge cases and improving debugging processes.

- [Full-breadth Developers](https://justin.searls.co/posts/full-breadth-developers/)

The author discusses how the rise of generative AI is transforming the software industry, creating opportunities for full-breadth developers‚Äîthose with both technical and product skills. These developers are excelling due to their ability to leverage new tools effectively, enabling them to complete tasks much faster.

- [AI is a Floor Raiser, not a Ceiling Raiser](https://elroy.bot/blog/2025/07/29/ai-is-a-floor-raiser-not-a-ceiling-raiser.html)

The article discusses how AI reshapes the learning curve by meeting learners at their skill levels, making initial learning stages easier. However, mastery remains challenging due to AI's limitations in handling advanced or controversial topics. It also highlights the potential for cheating, where relying solely on AI can lead to a plateau in skills.

- [Vibe code is legacy code](https://blog.val.town/vibe-code)

This blog highlights that vibe coding quickly generates tech debt as the produced code often becomes legacy code‚Äîdifficult to understand or maintain. Vibe coding works well for prototypes and throwaway projects but is risky for large, maintainable systems, especially if done by non-programmers. Serious coding with AI requires caution, thorough understanding, and careful maintenance. The author emphasizes that while AI changes programming, deep technical knowledge and theory-building remain essential.
