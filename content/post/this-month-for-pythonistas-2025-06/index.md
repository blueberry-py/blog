## Events & Social

DjangoCon US 2025 is coming this September in Chicago, United States. The in-person tickets are officially on sale now. You can also choose to attend online with even Sprints options available.

## New versions

### Python 3.14.0 beta 3

The third beta release of 3.14 is here! Source code as well as binary distributions can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3140b3/).

### Python 3.13.5

Python 3.13.4 was an expected release early this month but was found to be having bugs. So another bugfix release 3.13.5 is out soon after.

### Python 3.12.11, 3.11.13, 3.10.18 and 3.9.23

These are regular security releases with only offical tarball distributions. And remember that Python 3.9 is going to reach its end of life this October.

## Tutorials

- Deeplearning.ai's [DSPy: Build and Optimize Agentic Apps](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/dspy-build-optimize-agentic-apps/) from DataBricks

> This course teaches you how to use DSPy to build and optimize LLM-powered applications. You‚Äôll write programs using DSPy‚Äôs signature-based programming model, debug them with MLflow tracing, and automatically improve their accuracy with DSPy Optimizer. Along the way, you‚Äôll see how DSPy helps you easily switch models, manage complexity, and build agents that are both powerful and easy to maintain.

- Deeplearning.ai's [Orchestrating Workflows for GenAI Applications](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/orchestrating-workflows-for-genai-applications/) from Astronomer

> In this course, you‚Äôll learn how to turn a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) prototype into a robust, automated pipeline using Airflow 3.0, a leading open-source orchestration tool. You‚Äôll build two workflows for a typical RAG application: one that ingests and embeds book description texts into a vector database, and another that queries that database to recommend books.

- Deeplearning.ai's [Building with Llama 4](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-with-llama-4/) from Meta

> In hands-on lessons, you‚Äôll build apps using Llama 4‚Äôs long-context and its new multi-modal capabilities including reasoning across multiple images and "image grounding" in which you can identify elements and reason within specific image regions.

- Deeplearning.ai's [ACP: Agent Communication Protocol](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/acp-agent-communication-protocol/) from BeeAI and Linux Foundation

> You‚Äôll learn how to wrap an agent inside an ACP server and set up an ACP client to connect to the server. You‚Äôll build sequential and hierarchical workflows of agents hosted inside ACP servers, and learn how to manage this workflow on the client side through a process or another agent.

- RealPython's [How Can You Structure Your Python Script?](https://realpython.com/python-script-structure/)

This is a comprehensive guide on structuring a standalone, shareable Python script, including specifying its dependencies in the script itself following PEP 723, handling CLI inputs, proprerly logging, and more.

## Articles

- [PEP 734 ‚Äì Multiple Interpreters in the Stdlib](https://peps.python.org/pep-0734/)

PEP 734 is **accepted**. It proposes to add a new module, `interpreters`, to support inspecting, creating, and running code in multiple interpreters in the current process.

- [PEP 779 ‚Äì Criteria for supported status for free-threaded Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0779/)

PEP 779 is **accepted**, which means that staring from Python 3.14 a "No-GIL" build is officially supported instead of being in "experimental" status like in Python 3.13.

- [How local variables work in Python bytecode](https://fromscratchcode.com/blog/how-local-variables-work-in-python-bytecode/)

Local variables are stored on the stack, specifically within the evaluation stack of a Frame in the CallStack. Despite this, most Python variables are actually references to objects stored on the heap. The post illustrates this concept through a simple function, demonstrating how the stack changes as the function executes.

- [Google decided to donate Agent2Agent protocol/project to Linux Foundation](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/google-cloud-donates-a2a-to-linux-foundation/)

The Linux Foundation has announced the creation of the Agent2Agent (A2A) project, which aims to develop an open standard protocol that enables AI agents from different vendors to communicate, collaborate, and share information securely. Google Cloud contributed the A2A protocol specifications, SDKs, and developer tools.

- [How we built our multi-agent research system](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/built-multi-agent-research-system)

This post by Anthropic gives a behind-the-scenes look at how they set up a system where multiple AI agents can work together on different tasks. Think of it like a digital teamwork lab, where AI agents can play different roles‚Äîlike writers, editors, or problem-solvers‚Äîand collaborate to get things done.

The team designed the system to be super flexible, so they could easily run different types of experiments. Some agents work together on writing tasks, while others negotiate or help delegate work among themselves. It‚Äôs all about seeing how AIs interact, cooperate, and sometimes even challenge each other.

Building this wasn‚Äôt all smooth sailing‚Äîthey had to deal with tricky prompts, keep experiments reproducible, and figure out how to measure how well the agents were doing. Along the way, they learned a lot: use clear building blocks, design thoughtful communication between agents, and always keep good logs.

- [Agentic Search for Dummies](https://benanderson.work/blog/agentic-search-for-dummies/)

This blog post discusses building a search agent that uses full-text search with offline document augmentation to let AI models dynamically gather context from a large document corpus. The system uses a search index (Tantivy) and a set of tools to enable a language model to issue multiple queries, fuse results, and read selected documents iteratively until it produces a final answer. The post argues against relying on dense embeddings due to complexity and overhead, advocating for full-text search as a more predictable and effective method for agentic search.

- [O(no) You Didn't üò±](https://mrshiny608.github.io/MrShiny608/optimisation/2025/04/22/OhNoYouDidnt.html)

This article discusses the difference between theoretical Big-O performance and real-world performance, emphasizing that actual speed depends on context and profiling. Using a "Two Sum" problem as an example, it compares the brute-force O(n^2) approach with an optimized O(n) hashmap method. The article explains how memory access times and hardware factors influence performance, illustrating that understanding practical bottlenecks is crucial beyond just Big-O notation.

- [How to Vibe Code as a Senior Engineer](https://blog.alexmaccaw.com/how-to-vibe-code-as-a-senior-engineer/)

Despite concerns about AI-generated code quality, recent advancements in AI models have made vibe coding a valuable tool for experienced engineers. However, human oversight remains crucial for guiding architecture and ensuring code quality. The author emphasizes the importance of using a robust scaffold, establishing clear rules, and providing perfect context for optimal AI performance.

- [Will AI Replace Junior Developers? I Asked Experts at Pycon US](https://blog.adarshd.dev/posts/pycon-us-ai-and-future-of-programming/)

The blog discusses whether AI will replace junior developers, based on conversations at PyCon US. Most experts believe AI won't fully replace programmers but will change how they work, especially in tasks like boilerplate coding. Key figures like **Guido van Rossum** and **Trey Hunner** see AI as a tool for improving productivity rather than a threat. Some, like **Samuel Colvin**, think AI could replace certain roles to increase efficiency.

- [Don't Build Multi-Agents](https://cognition.ai/blog/dont-build-multi-agents)

The article argues against building multi-agent systems due to their fragility and context sharing challenges. It advocates for principles like sharing full context and implicit decision-making to build reliable AI agents. The author suggests simpler, single-threaded, linear agents or long-context compressed systems for better reliability.
