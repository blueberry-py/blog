Welcome to **This Month for Pythonistas**, a monthly update dedicated to Python developers, professionals, and hobbyists.

In this issue, I would like to compile a list of news, articles, repositories, and tools worth noting in March 2025, as well as other fun stuff that is not necessarily bound to Python.

Ready? Let's get started!

## New versions

### ipython 9.0.1

The first major version update in three years. [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/ipython/9.0.1/)

## Tutorials

- Deeplearning.ai [Event-Driven Agentic Document Workflows](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/event-driven-agentic-document-workflows/) from LlamaIndex

> Build an event-driven agentic workflow that parses forms, retrieves relevant information from a source document using RAG, and returns answers to the form’s fields as structured outputs.

## Articles

TBD

## Podcasts

### RealPython PodCast

- [Episode 241: Deciphering Python Jargon & Compiling Python 1.0](https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/241/)

### Python Bytes Podcast

- [#422 You need 4 spaces](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/422/you-need-4-spaces)

### Pybites Podcast

- [#183: AI’s silent takeover - are we losing our programming skills?](https://www.pybitespodcast.com/1501156/episodes/16730593-183-ai-s-silent-takeover-are-we-losing-our-programming-skills)

## Tools

### Warp on Windows

Warp is one of my favorite new toys in year 2024, and now it comes to Windows platform. Check their [blog](https://www.warp.dev/blog/launching-warp-on-windows)!

### Cherry Studio 1.0.6

Cherry Studio catches quite a lot of eyes recently, and it just reaches 1.0 release not too long ago. [official download](https://cherry-ai.com/download)

## Repositories

### lmstudio-python 1.0.1

I personally have been using [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) for roughly one year, and this `lmstudio-python` (alongside lmstudio-js for JavaScript) is their official SDK with which you can easily manage the models, conversations and more using pure Python code. They have documentations too: [docs](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/python)

The source code is hosted on [github](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/lmstudio-python).

## Time for some fun?

### Command & Conquer games go open-source

EA chose to open-source some of the classic C&C games on github, potentially enriching the Modding community support.

They are on github too.
